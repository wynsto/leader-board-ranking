# This is a demo app for real-time leader board ranking.

## How to start
To start the development client/server, in the project directory, install the dependency by `npm install` then you can run `npm run dev`. This command will start web client and websocket server at the sametime. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

The web site will connnet to the websocket server automaticly. If website connects to the websockets server successfully an success message **"WebSocket Connected"** will be display. Otherwise an error message **"WebSocket Disconnected"** will be shown on the top. User can click **"Connect"** button to connect the websocket server manually.

The original players score are randomed generated by nodejs library. So each time, you restart the websocket server the list will be different because they are saved in memory only.

This app have two modes:
* game player mode: user can view real time player leading score ranking.
* admin mode: admin can use this mode modify the player's score, or add new play name/score to the list, but only top 10 player will be shown in the list.
